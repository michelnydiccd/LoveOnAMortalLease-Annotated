Eleanor, dressed in her best silk gown—a hand-me-down from her mother—felt both exhilarated and utterly out of place. The air hummed with conversation, the clink of crystal, and the strains of a string quartet.

Lady Catherine, a woman of formidable presence and sharp intellect, greeted her with a scrutinizing gaze. "So you are the daughter of Mr. Vere," she said, her tone neither warm nor cold. "I have heard of your father's work. A pity he could not join us."

Eleanor murmured a polite response, her eyes scanning the room. She recognized a few faces from newspaper sketches: poets, politicians, a famous actress holding court by the fireplace. Then her gaze fell upon a tall, dark-haired man standing apart, seemingly absorbed in a volume of verse. There was an air of solitude about him that drew her curiosity.
