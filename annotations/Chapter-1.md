# Chapter 1 Annotations

## The influence of Dante on Chapter 4
Although the actual text of Chapter 4 is missing, we can infer the influence of Dante.

## The theme of transience and mortal lease
This central motif of "mortal lease" runs throughout the novel. We can see how it shapes the characters' choices. In my annotations, I will explore the philosophical underpinnings of this concept, its roots in classical and Romantic literature, and how it shapes the novel's melancholic tone.

## The role of social class
One of the major themes is the role of social class in the novel. This theme is central to the novel's plot.

## Symbolism of setting
The novel uses setting as a symbol of the characters' own sense of place. This is a key element of the novel's melancholic tone.
