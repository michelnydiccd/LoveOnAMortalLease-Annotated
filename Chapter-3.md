# Chapter 3

The following week brought a note from Mr. Thorne, inviting Eleanor to walk with him in Hyde Park. Her father, with a mixture of pride and anxiety, gave his consent, warning her to remember the "proprieties." Eleanor, her heart aflutter, chose a simple walking dress and a hat adorned with a single ribbon.

They met near the Serpentine, the afternoon sun dappling the water. Thorne was more talkative than she had anticipated, speaking of his travels in Italy, his admiration for the Pre‑Raphaelite painters, and his own struggles to capture beauty in words.

"Beauty is a fleeting tenant," he said, gesturing toward a swan gliding past. "We borrow it for a moment, but it never truly belongs to us."

Eleanor felt a thrill of recognition. "That is exactly what I have often thought," she confessed. "It is as if we hold everything on a mortal lease."

Thorne looked at her intently. "You understand," he said softly. "Most people see only the surface—the pretty picture. They do not feel the underlying transience."

They walked in companionable silence for a while, the crunch of gravel underfoot marking the passage of time. Eleanor sensed that this meeting might be the beginning of something significant—or perhaps merely another beautiful, ephemeral moment in a life full of them.
