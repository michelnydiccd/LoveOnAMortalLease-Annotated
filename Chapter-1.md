# Chapter 1

The morning mist clung to the London streets with a persistence that seemed almost personal. Eleanor Vere, standing at the window of her modest lodgings in Bloomsbury, watched the grey shapes of early commers emerge and dissolve like phantoms. She was not yet twenty, but already the weight of her family's expectations lay upon her shoulders like a damp cloak.

Her father, a scholar of modest means, had invested all his hopes in her marriage to a man of substance. Yet Eleanor's own heart yearned for something more—a connection of minds, a meeting of souls. The phrase "love on a mortal lease" had often echoed in her thoughts, a reminder of the fleeting nature of earthly attachments.

A knock at the door startled her from her reverie. It was the postman, bearing a letter sealed with a crest she did not recognise. Her fingers trembled slightly as she broke the wax; within was an invitation to a soirée at the home of Lady Catherine Montford, a distant relation known for her literary salons.

Could this be the turning point? Eleanor wondered, as she read the elegant script. Perhaps, amid the chatter and clinking glasses, she might find a kindred spirit—or at least a temporary reprieve from the monotony of her days.
